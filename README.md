I experienced this bug while trying to run `npx expo run:ios --device`:

```
Error: EMFILE: too many open files, watch at FSEvent.FSWatcher._handle.onchange (node:internal/fs/watchers:207:21)
```

Despite of thousands times trying to reinstall the package and watchman, I still got the bug.
Here is the solution:

```
brew install watchman # reinstall if need
watchman shutdown-server
watchman watch .
watchman watch-list | jq '.roots | length' # should return 1
```
